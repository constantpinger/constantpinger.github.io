# Creating a Blog on Github Pages v Wordpress

This is the first blog style page written within GH Pages and falls around the 4 hour point in the journey to understanding the technology. Upon hearing about the concept I thought this would be a brilliant way to produce content about code I've written or tech battles I've won/lost. I love Github and really like having a personal treasure chest of all the work I've created in one place.

The reality has been similar to when you spill the ready meal onto your plate having slavoured over the delicious picture on the packaging for the 4 minues of microwaving. Not exactly what I was hoping for to the point of potentially being against the trades description act.


Things I've learnt that aren't mentioned in the "really really easy guides to get you up and running in 2.3 seconds"
1. It takes upto a minute from commiting a file to the update being available to a web browser
2. You have to learn a new coding technology (jekyll)
